    "## Introduction to 3DVar\n",
    "\n",
    "*For those familiar with the 3DVar data-assimilation method this section can be skipped.* <br>\n",
    "3DVar is a data-assimilation method that solves the data-assimilation problem at a given point in time. The basic idea is that we have a first guess of the atmospheric state from a model forecast $x_b$, and want to update this state with a set of observations $y$ obtained at this time. These observations are from the unknown true atmospheric state, and the measurement process is described by <br>\n",
    "<center>$y = H(x_{true}) + \\epsilon_{true}$ </center> <br>\n",
    "in which $H(..)$ is the so-called observation operator that maps a state $x$ to observation space. The $\\epsilon_{true}$ is the observation error. This error is due to the measurement process itself: every measurement will have an error related to the precision of the measurement. There is also another part to this error, called the representation error, that we will not discuss here as it is not essential for understanding 3DVar. <br><br>\n",
    "The 3DVar tries to find the state that is both close to our first guess $x_b$ and close to the observations $y$. It seems natural to measure closeness in terms of the uncertainty in each of them. If the first guess is less certain, the solution doesn't have to be that close to the prior than if it had very small uncertainty. This suggests to set up a variational problem in which we minimize a so-called cost function J(x), defined as <br>\n",
    "<center>$J(x) = \\frac{(x-x_b)^2}{\\sigma_b^2} + \\frac{(y-x)^2}{\\sigma_y^2}$ </center> <br>\n",
    "in which $\\sigma_b$ is the standard deviation of the error in $x_b$, and $\\sigma_y$ is the standard deviation of the error in $y$. If, for instance, $\\sigma_b$ is much larger than $\\sigma_y$ the first term will become important in the cost function for large variations of $x$ from $x_b$, while the second term becomes important for much smaller variations of $x$ from $y$. This shows that this cost function makes sense. (This cost function might seem ad hoc, but it can be derived from Bayes Theorem.) The minimum of this cost function is found by setting its gradient to zero. In this simple problem we find for the gradient:<br>\n",
    "<center>$\\frac{d J(x)}{dx} = 2\\frac{(x-x_b)}{\\sigma_b^2} + 2\\frac{(y-x)}{\\sigma_y^2}$ </center> <br>\n",
    "which we can solve for $x=x_a$, the state at which the gradient is zero, as<br>\n",
    "<center>$x_a=x_b +\\frac{\\sigma_b^2}{\\sigma_b^2+\\sigma_y^2}(y-x_b)$ </center> <br>\n",
    "We see that the analysis state is a linear combination of the first guess and the observation. To see this more clearly we can rewrite the equation as <br>\n",
    "<center>$x_a=\\frac{\\sigma_y^2}{\\sigma_b^2+\\sigma_y^2}x_b +\\frac{\\sigma_b^2}{\\sigma_b^2+\\sigma_y^2}y$ </center> <br>\n",
    "where the analysis is expressed as a weighted average of first guess and observation. When the observation error is much larger than the model error the weight on the first guess $x_b$ is much larger than the weight on the observation, so the analysis will be close to the first guess. This is exactly what we want the data assimilation to do: the analysis should be closest to the quantity with the smallest error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3DVar method allows for extending the cost function in two ways, the problem can be multi-dimensional and the observation operator can be nonlinear. This leads to a cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$J(x) = (x-x_b)^TB^{-1}(x-x_b) + \\left(y-H(x)\\right)^T R^{-1}\\left(y-H(x)\\right)$ </center> <br>\n",
    "The deviation of $x$ from $x_b$ is weighted by the first-guess error covariance $B$, and deviation of $x$ from $y$ is weighted by the observation error covariance. The gradient of the cost function is given by <br>\n",
    "<center>$\\frac{d J(x)}{dx} = 2B^{-1}(x-x_b) - 2H^T R^{-1}\\left(y-H(x)\\right)$ </center> <br>\n",
    "Note the similarity with and the difference from the scalar case above, especially the error variances there and the covariance matrices here. If $H(..)$ is a linear function we can find an analytical expression for the state $x_a$ for which the gradient is zero. Doing that and collecting all appearances of $x-x_b$ on the left hand side and then subtract $H^TR^{-1}Hx_b$ from both sides of the equation results in <br>\n",
    "<center>$\\left(B^{-1}+H^TR^{-1}H \\right) (x_a-x_b) =  H^T R^{-1}(y-Hx_b)$ </center> <br><br>\n",
    "The solution is now obtained as:<br>\n",
    "<center>$x_a = x_b + \\left(B^{-1}+H^TR^{-1}H \\right)^{-1}H^T R^{-1}(y-Hx_b)$ </center> <br>\n",
    "which some of you might recognize as the Kalman filter solution in precision form. Indeed, 3DVar and the Kalman Filter give the same solution as the 3DVar when $H(..)$ is linear. We can rewrite this equation as<br>\n",
    "<center>$x_a = \\left(B^{-1}+H^TR^{-1}H \\right)^{-1} B^{-1}x_b + \\left(B^{-1}+H^TR^{-1}H \\right)^{-1}H^T R^{-1}y$ </center> <br>\n",
    "where we can immediately see how the first-guess and observation covariances determine the analysis state. When the observation covariance is large, so the observations are inaccurate, the first term dominates and the analysis is close to the first guess. If, on the other hand, the observations are very accurate the second term dominates and the analysis will be closer to the observations.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the connection with the scalar case we can use some matrix identities to rewrite the analysis equation as the standard covariance form of the Kalman filter<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$x_a = x_b + BH^T\\left(HBH^T+R \\right)^{-1}(y-Hx_b)$ </center> <br>\n",
    "We can multiply this equation with H and rewrite it as<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$Hx_a = R\\left(HBH^T+R \\right)^{-1}x_b + BH^T\\left(HBH^T+R \\right)^{-1}y$ </center> <br>\n",
    "and a direct identification with the scalar case can be made in terms of error variances in the scalar case and error covariances in the multi-dimensional case. The 3DVar solution is a weighted average between the first guess in observation space and the observations, with the weight determined by the covariances of first guess and observation errors.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to Kalman filter equation in covariance form, which, as mentions is also the solution of the 3DVar problem, the importance of the $B$ matrix becomes apparent. The so-called innovation $y-Hx_b$, so the difference between the observation and the model forecast in observation space, is first multiplied by $\\left(HBH^T+R \\right)^{-1}$, and the resulting vector is still in observation space. The transition to state space is made via the multiplication by $BH^T$. Assume that we only have one observation of, say, pressure at a certain point in space. That observation will not only update the pressure at that point, but it will influence many other variables too, depending on the covariance structure of the B matrix.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When $H(..)$ is nonlinear we cannot write down an explicit solution, and instead have to use iterative methods to solve this problem. This makes the 3DVar, which is an iterative method, more general than the Kalman Filter.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even when $H(..)$ is linear the 3DVar has advantages in high-dimensional problems such as atmospheric or oceanic data assimilation. When we look at the solution we see that we need the inverse of the background error covariance B, which is a huge matrix. In fact, it is typically so large that we cannot even store it on a computer, let alone determine its inverse. For this reason a 3DVar is typically implemented as follows. First, a control-variable transformation is used, in which a new variable $u$ is defined via $x-x_b = B u$. (Note that it is also possible to use $B^{1/2}$ in the transform, but JEDI uses $B$.) Then the problem<br><br>\n",
    "<center>$\\left(B^{-1}+H^TR^{-1}H \\right) (x-x_b) =  H^T R^{-1}(y-Hx_b)$ </center> <br>\n",
    "becomes<br>\n",
    "<center>$\\left(I+H^TR^{-1}HB \\right) u =  H^T R^{-1}(y-Hx_b)$ </center> <br>\n",
    "which is of the form $Au = b$, and this equation is solved iteratively. The matrix $B$ is not stored as a matrix, but instead as a piece of code that takes as input a vector $u$, and generates as output $B u$.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "With this we are at the end of this short introduction of 3DVar. Next we very briefly describe the quasi-geostrophic model, before we dive into the experiments with JEDI."

    "## The Quasi-geostrophic model\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides a short description of the quasi-geostrophic model used in the experiments below. The model evolves the potential vorticity over time, with a velocity field derived from the stream function. In turn, the stream function field is calculated from the potential vorticity. Mathematically, the model has two layers and for each layer the model equations are <br>\n",

This parameter describes the daily rotation of the Earth around it axis. The actual expressions for the $\\mathcal{F}$ will not be given here, but, as you would expect, they contain the layer thicknesses and the potential temperatures of the layers. <br> <br>\n",
    "The conservation equation for potential vorticity describes the balance of changes in relative vorticity, in planetary vorticity, and in stretching of the fluid column. When one or more of these term changes the others have to compensate to conserve potential vorticity. <br> <br>\n",
    "The model represents a zonal strip around the Earth, so the fields are periodic in the East-West direction and we use free slip on the northern and southern boundaries (which means that the meridional velocities are zero along those boundaries, but the zonal velocities are free to vary). <br>"

    "## 3DVar data-assimilation experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up the data assimilation experiment and run 3DVar we take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first generate the equivalent of a real atmospheric or oceanic, or other system. This run we call the truth, and in the following we will use the atmosphere as an example.\n",
    "2. We then generate the starting point for our data assimilation experiment. This starting point will be close to, but not the same as, the truth starting point. To be consistent, we perturb the truth state with a random draw from the initial state error distribution. In 3DVar this error distribution is again chosen Gaussian. In the real world this background state comes from a forecast, and contains all prior information we have.\n",
    "3. Then we obtain observations from that truth run, just as observations are generated in the real world. That is, we take measurements of that truth run and then add an observation error to that measurement. This observation error is a random draw from the error distribution of the observations. In 3DVar the assumption is that observation errors are Gaussian distributed. We do all this to mimic what happens when we take real observations from the real atmosphere.\n",
    "4. The final step is to perform the data assimilation, i.e. to run the 3DVar.\n",

    "Let's see if this figure make sense, and learn a lot about the working of 3DVar in the process. The figure shows the increment in the observed variable, the stream function. But wait, we only observed one grid point in the upper layer, but we see analysis increments *in a much larger area*. To understand this, remember the 3DVar update equation, which for a linear observation operator $H$ is equal to that of the Kalman filter:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$x_a = x_b + BH^T\\left(HBH^T+R \\right)^{-1}(y-Hx_b)$</center><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is only one observation $R$ is a scalar, the observation error variance. This means that $HBH^T$ also has to be a scalar (and it is indeed). Remember hat $H$ maps the state vector in observation space, so the full 1600 (40 by 20 by 2) dimensional state vector is mapped to a 1-dimensional scalar. This means that $H$ is a matrix with 1 row and 1600 columns, and $HBH^T$ is just a scalar.<br><br>\n",
    "Hence, the spreading of information over the larger domain has to come from $BH^T$, which is a matrix of size 1600 by 1. Indeed, it maps the scaled innovation $\\left(HBH^T+R \\right)^{-1}(y-Hx_b)$ back to state space. The covariances between grid points in the prior error covariance $B$ spread this information out in state space. Remember that the spatial length scale in the $B$ matrix is 2200 km, and the grid spacing is ???km, so 2.2 grid points. The figure shows that the spread of information is indeed about twice as large as the correlation length scale specified for the B matrix, as expected for a Gaussian correlation structure.<br><br>\n",
    "This raises the question is we could set this correlation length scale much larger, for instance to get an update over the whole domain just from one observation. Pushing this a bit, one might argue that satellites are not needed, we just need a set of well chosen surface observations and large length scales in the $B$ matrix. However, that thinking is incorrect. The $B$ matrix should contain the length scales of the physical processes. The relevant processes are the high- and low pressure systems, as seen in the true state, one of the first figures in this tutorial above. Indeed, the length scales of the increment have the length scales seen in that figure, which means that we have set the length scales in the $B$ matrix correctly.<br><br>\n",
    "The physical reason for this length scale is that a pressure perturbation at a certain grid point will be physically related to other pressure perturbations around it, and the typical length scale of these relations is the length scale that should be used in the $B$ matrix.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A question: back to the figure, we only observed a grid point in the upper layer, but there is an increment in the lower layer too. Can you figure out why, perhaps from the yaml file used to generate the 3Dvar solution, or in the yaml file used to generate the background state?<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, it is the **vertical_length_scale**, which is set to 15000 m. Given the layer thicknesses of 4000 and 6000 m, the two layers are highly correlated, and an increment in the upper layer will be quite similar in the lower layer.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final thing we will look at the **magnitude** of the increment. At the observation location we can write, because we have only one observation:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<center> $x_a = x_b + b\\left(b+r \\right)^{-1}(y-x_b)$ </center> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "in which $b$ is the background error variance at the observed location, $r$ is the variance of the observation error, and we removed the $H$ because we are observing the stream function directly at this grid point, so $H=1$. Using this equation and the values for $b$ from the background error standard deviation ($1.8e7 m^2/s$, so $b = 3.24e14$) and for $r$ from the observation error standard deviation ($4.0e6\\;m^2/s$, so $r=1.6e13$), and your values for the observation and the background state at that grid point (estimate the latter from the background error and the truth value in the observation file), check that the value of the stream function increment makes sense.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For our set of random numbers we obtained $y=-2.18e8$ and $x_b \\approx -2.1e8 - 1.9e7 = -2.29e8$, leading to an estimate analysis increment for the stream function of $0.95*(-2.18e8-(-2.29e8)) = 1.0e7$, while the 3DVar analysis in the figure gives about $1.3e7$. This is consistent given our very rough estimate. (Note that this should be an exact match, and it will be if the exact background and analysis values are used.)\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "We can also look at how derived variables are affected by these increments in stream function. The next two figures show the zonal and meridional velocity increments.<br>\n",

    "<center>$u = -\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} \\;\\;\\;\\;\\; v = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}$</center> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Check that signs and orders of magnitude are indeed as you would expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these increments are directly derived from the increments in the stream function, this will be more interesting in a numerical weather prediction model. There the pressure (corresponding to the stream function in a QG model) and the velocities are not necessarily in geostrophic balance; we do have ageostrophic velocities in the real atmosphere, and in our more complete numerical models. Still, the velocity increments will be similar to a pressure observation. Why do you think that is?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that we know that the winds will be in geostrophic balance to a very large extend, so we will build an approximate geostrophic relation into the $B$ matrix. How this is done is beyond this tutorial, but this is standard practice in 3DVar, and has been for many decades.\n",

    "\n",
    "After you have done that, note the anti-cyclonic circulation related to the positive mass anomaly from the stream function increment field.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes the first 3DVar data-assimilation experiment. Please check that you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand how to generate a truth run, the background field, observations, and a data assimilation run in JEDI,\n",
    "2. Understand how the background error covariance matrix determines how observation information is spread around over the model state\n",
    "3. Get an initial idea of how error magnitudes influence the increments. More about that in the next experiments!\n",

    "On the last question, there is an interesting piece of theory in Kalman filtering that carries over directly to a 3DVar if the observation operator $H$ is linear. From the Kalman filter equations at the beginning of this 3DVar exercise we can derive an update equation for the model covariance matrix, as:\n",
    "<center> $P = (I-KH)B$ </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "By writing out that Kalman gain we find:\n",
    "<center> $P = B - BH^T(HBH^T + R)^{-1} HB \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ so that $ \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;Tr(P) = Tr(B) - Tr(BH^T(HBH^T + R)^{-1} HB)$  </center> \n",
    "\n",
    "All three matrices are symmetric positive semi definite, meaning that their eigenvalues are non-negative, and the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues. We thus see that $Tr(P) \\leq Tr(B)$. Now the trace of a covariance matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements, so the sum of the variances of all variables in the state vector. Hence, we find that the sum of the error variances of the analysis will be lower than that of the background error variances. This, then, shows that the average absolute value of the analysis errors is expected to be smaller than that of the background errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This comes feature of the Kalman filter, and hence the 3DVar for linear observation operators, can be traced back to its derivation: the Kalman filter can be derived as the minimum variance estimator for linear problems.\n",
